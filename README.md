# TheHive5 Webhook Reference

This repository contains `JSON` representations for several actions on `TheHive` to be used as a reference when building webhook receivers.

The webhooks come in two different versions [0](./v0) and [1](./v1), that are slightly different, but seem to cover the same actions.
